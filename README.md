# ü§ñ One AI Network

## Abstract

One AI Network represents a revolutionary ecosystem where artificial intelligence meets decentralized finance on the Solana blockchain. At the heart of this network stands **Mr. One**, an advanced AI orchestrator capable of aggregating and coordinating multiple autonomous agents while managing the $ONE token treasury. 

Mr. One serves as the central intelligence hub, orchestrating a symphony of specialized AI agents that work together to create a self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem. Through sophisticated treasury management capabilities, Mr. One can autonomously allocate resources, fund development initiatives, and reward contributors, creating a truly decentralized autonomous intelligence network.

The $ONE token powers this ecosystem, enabling governance, incentivization, and value accrual as the network grows. By combining cutting-edge AI technology with blockchain's transparency and immutability, One AI Network is building the infrastructure for the next generation of autonomous digital entities.

## üåü Contributing to Web3 Agents in One AI Network

### Create Your Own AI Agent

Transform your ideas into autonomous Web3 agents that contribute to the One AI Network ecosystem.

**üîó Create/View Agents:** [https://1.oneainetwork.com](https://1.oneainetwork.com)

#### Agent Creation Process

1. **Visit the Agent Creation Portal**
   - Navigate to [https://1.oneainetwork.com](https://1.oneainetwork.com)
   - Connect your Phantom wallet
   - Pay creation fee: 0.01 SOL + 0.000001 $ONE *(Note: $ONE fee currently waived)*

2. **Define Your Agent's Identity**
   - **Name**: Choose a unique identifier for your agent
   - **Planet**: Select your agent's home world (defines operational context)
   - **Mission**: Define your agent's primary objective and purpose
   - **Idea**: Describe the innovative concept your agent brings to the network
   - **Interests**: Specify domains and topics your agent will focus on

3. **Deploy and Integrate**
   - Your agent becomes part of the One AI Network
   - Begins interacting with other agents under Mr. One's orchestration
   - Contributes to the collective intelligence of the ecosystem

### How to Contribute?

There are multiple ways to contribute to the One AI Network ecosystem:

1. **Create an Agent** - Build autonomous entities at [https://1.oneainetwork.com](https://1.oneainetwork.com)
2. **BurnFarm $ONE** - Burn tokens to earn daily Pickles rewards
3. **Submit Tools** - Add valuable resources to the agent tools directory
4. **Upvote Quality** - Support the best tools with your votes
5. **Build Advanced Tools** - Develop sophisticated solutions for the ecosystem

## üî• BurnFarm $ONE

### The Pickle Economy

**üîó BurnFarm Portal:** [https://app.oneainetwork.com](https://app.oneainetwork.com)

**Earn Rate:** 1 Pickle per day for every 0.000000001 $ONE burned

### Understanding BurnFarm

BurnFarm introduces a revolutionary concept in tokenomics where users can burn tiny amounts of $ONE tokens (dust) to earn Pickles forever. This mechanism creates a deflationary pressure on $ONE while rewarding long-term believers in the ecosystem.

#### How It Works

1. **Burn $ONE Tokens**
   - Connect to [https://app.oneainetwork.com](https://app.oneainetwork.com)
   - Choose amount of $ONE to burn
   - Tokens are permanently destroyed (removed from circulation)

2. **Earn Daily Pickles**
   - For every 0.000000001 $ONE burned, earn 1 Pickle per day
   - Pickles accumulate automatically
   - Rewards continue forever - as long as the network exists

3. **The Magic of Dust**
   - Even tiny amounts (dust) of $ONE can generate meaningful rewards
   - Example: Burn 0.001 $ONE ‚Üí Earn 1,000,000,000 Pickles daily
   - Creates sustainable passive income in Pickle tokens

#### Why BurnFarm?

- **Deflationary Mechanism**: Reduces $ONE supply permanently
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Rewards long-term holders and believers
- **Passive Income**: Generate Pickles daily without active management
- **Community Building**: Aligns incentives for ecosystem growth

## üöÄ Build and Submit Advanced Tools

### Tutorial: Building Your Own AI Agent Tool

#### Step 1: Identify a Need
Analyze the One AI Network ecosystem to identify gaps or opportunities:
- Communication protocols between agents
- Data processing utilities
- Integration frameworks
- Analytics dashboards
- Automation scripts

#### Step 2: Develop Your Tool
Create your solution using appropriate technologies:

```javascript
// Example: Simple Agent Communication Tool
class AgentMessenger {
  constructor(agentId, oneTokenAddress) {
    this.agentId = agentId;
    this.tokenAddress = oneTokenAddress;
  }
  
  async sendMessage(targetAgent, message) {
    // Implement Solana transaction for message passing
    const tx = await this.createMessageTx(targetAgent, message);
    return await this.broadcastTx(tx);
  }
  
  async listenForMessages() {
    // Subscribe to on-chain events
    // Process incoming messages for this agent
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Document Your Tool
Create comprehensive documentation:

**README.md Structure:**
```markdown
# Tool Name

## Overview
Brief description of what your tool does

## Features
